DetectLocations is an app that shows your pictures on a map visualized. It's useful to give you a good sense of where you've been, and where you haven't been yet. 
Additionally it allows you to show pictures that were taken on transport (e.g. car, plane), so it's easier to find them.
Also, you can show a route of all the places you've taken pictures in.
